## #2 General Checks 
[Watch a demo video for Checks feature.](https://youtu.be/R4M_TBSRWSE)

These checks run for all translated strings when page loads and when a translation is submitted. <br> Checks can be set as: Warning & prevent save, Just notification or Don't check.


**Notices and labels** for checks results

**Highlights** double spaces and user defined "bad words" *(eg. below: link)*

**Prevent saving these words** is a user defined list of words that if found in a translation will generate a warning. Separated by comma, no space, case insensitive.

**Count and match these** is a user defined list of terms or symbols that will be counted both in original and in translation. If counts don't match, a warning will be generated. Separated by comma, no space, case insensitive.

Filter strings based on warnings: <br>

## #3 Locale specific Checks

If your locale uses a different symbol other than `.` for period, you can set it here. Additional specific locale checks can be added if requested in an issue.

## Installation
Only choose one of these two:

### Chrome, Edge, Opera & Brave

1. Get the latest release from [here](https://github.com/vlad-timotei/wpgp-tools/releases/latest) and extract to a folder.
2. Open extensions at `chrome://extensions/`, `edge://extensions/`, `opera://extensions/` or `brave://extensions/`
4. Enable **Developer mode** toggle
3. Click **Load Unpacked** button and point to the `wpgp-tools\src\` folder
4. That's it! Go to a translate.w.org project to see it in action and customize its settings.

### Firefox and other browsers via Tampermonkey

1. Install the [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) browser extensions.
2. Visit [this page](https://github.com/vlad-timotei/wpgp-tools/raw/main/userscript/wpgpt-userscript-latest.user.js). TamperMonkey should take over from there and prompt to install the userscript.
If this somehow fails, you can: manually copy the URL and install it in the Utilities > Install from URL or manually copy the script, click the + button and install it.

- The first time you use Search in multiple projects feature, the browser will prevent opening multiple tabs. 
- Click on Options > Allow pop-ups for translate.wordpress.org and this will work properly in the future.

## Backup & Restore Settings

 <img align="right" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65488419/127963637-fde72b20-c931-43db-a187-3c3aa9a08044.gif">

Your settings are saved **locally** using LocalStorage so they will remain saved in that browser untill you clear your browser data.
To backup and restore WPGPT settings:

 - Go to Settings.
 - Drag and drop **Backup WPGPT Settings** to your Bookmarks bar.
 - Restore your settings by clicking that bookmark.
 
## Known issues
- Tooltips overlap for the Quick Links section (should be fixed upstream)
- It's an unpacked extension and the repo doesn't use workflows to build the release additional zip

## Future version features

- Personal translation notes & project status snippets
- ~~Personal glossary~~ (this is included in [WPTranslationFiller extension](https://github.com/vibgyj/WPTranslationFiller/) and [GlotDict](https://github.com/Mte90/GlotDict) and I don't plan to overlap features!)
- Gradually, some WPGPT features will be implemented in GlotDict, as part of a cross-project initiative. That said, WPGPT will continue to exist for those interested.
- When a feature will be included in GlotPress (the long term plan for as many features as possible) it will be excluded from this extension.
